### Updating Code

If you want to update instantly, you can check out the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/syncing-a-fork) to learn how to synchronize a forked project with upstream code.

You can star or watch this project or follow author to get release notifications in time.

## Environment Variables

#### `GEMINI_API_KEY` (optional)

Your Gemini api key. If you need to `enable` the server api, this is required.

#### `GEMINI_API_BASE_URL` (optional)

> Default: `https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com`

> Examples: `http://your-gemini-proxy.com`

Override Gemini api request base url. **To avoid server-side proxy url leaks, links in front-end pages will not be overwritten. **

#### `GEMINI_UPLOAD_BASE_URL` (optional)

> Default: `https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com`

> Example: `http://your-gemini-upload-proxy.com`

Override Gemini file upload api base url. **To avoid server-side proxy url leaks, links in front-end pages will not be overwritten. **

#### `NEXT_PUBLIC_GEMINI_MODEL_LIST` (optional)

Custom model list, default: all.

#### `NEXT_PUBLIC_ASSISTANT_INDEX_URL` (optional)

> Default: `https://chat-agents.lobehub.com`

> Examples: `http://your-assistant-market-proxy.com`

Override assistant market api request base url. The api link in the front-end interface will be adjusted synchronously.

#### `NEXT_PUBLIC_UPLOAD_LIMIT` (optional)

File upload size limit. There is no file size limit by default.

#### `ACCESS_PASSWORD` (optional)

Access password.

#### `HEAD_SCRIPTS` (optional)

Injected script code can be used for statistics or error tracking.

#### `EXPORT_BASE_PATH` (optional)

Only used to set the page base path in [static deployment](#static-deployment) mode.

### Access Password

This project provides limited access control. Please add an environment variable named `ACCESS_PASSWORD` on the vercel environment variables page.

After adding or modifying this environment variable, please redeploy the project for the changes to take effect.

### Custom model list

This project supports custom model lists. Please add an environment variable named `NEXT_PUBLIC_GEMINI_MODEL_LIST` in the `.env` file or environment variables page.

The default model list is represented by `all`, and multiple models are separated by `,`.

If you need to add a new model, please directly write the model name `all,new-model-name`, or use the `+` symbol plus the model name to add, that is, `all,+new-model-name`.

If you want to remove a model from the model list, use the `-` symbol followed by the model name to indicate removal, i.e. `all,-existing-model-name`. If you want to remove the default model list, you can use `-all`.

If you want to set a default model, you can use the `@` symbol plus the model name to indicate the default model, that is, `all,@default-model-name`.

## Development

If you have not installed pnpm

```shell
npm install -g pnpm
```

```shell
# 1. install nodejs and yarn first
# 2. config local variables, please change `.env.example` to `.env` or `.env.local`
# 3. run
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

### Requirements

NodeJS >= 18, Docker >= 20

## Deployment

### Docker (Recommended)

> The Docker version needs to be 20 or above, otherwise it will prompt that the image cannot be found.

> ⚠️ Note: Most of the time, the docker version will lag behind the latest version by 1 to 2 days, so the "update exists" prompt will continue to appear after deployment, which is normal.

```shell
docker pull xiangfa/talk-with-gemini:latest

docker run -d --name talk-with-gemini -p 5481:3000 xiangfa/talk-with-gemini
```

You can also specify additional environment variables:

```shell
docker run -d --name talk-with-gemini \
   -p 5481:3000 \
   -e GEMINI_API_KEY=AIzaSy... \
   -e ACCESS_PASSWORD=your-password \
   xiangfa/talk-with-gemini
```

If you need to specify other environment variables, please add `-e key=value` to the above command to specify it.

Deploy using `docker-compose.yml`:

```shell
version: '3.9'
services:
   talk-with-gemini:
      image: xiangfa/talk-with-gemini
      container_name: talk-with-gemini
      environment:
         - GEMINI_API_KEY=AIzaSy...
         - ACCESS_PASSWORD=your-password
      ports:
         - 5481:3000
```

### Static Deployment

You can also build a static page version directly, and then upload all files in the `out` directory to any website service that supports static pages, such as Github Page, Cloudflare, Vercel, etc..

```shell
pnpm build:export
```

If you deploy the project in a subdirectory and encounter resource loading failures when accessing, please add `EXPORT_BASE_PATH=/path/project` in the `.env` file or variable setting page.

## FAQ

#### Solution for “User location is not supported for the API use”

1. Use Cloudflare AI Gateway to forward APIs. Currently, Cloudflare AI Gateway already supports Google Vertex AI related APIs. For how to use it, please refer to [How to Use Cloudflare AI Gateway](./docs/Use-Cloudflare-AI-Gateway.md). This solution is fast and stable, and is **recommended**.

2. Use Cloudflare Worker for API proxy forwarding. For detailed settings, please refer to [How to Use Cloudflare Worker Proxy API](./docs/How-to-deploy-the-Cloudflare-Worker-api-proxy.md). Note that this solution may not work properly in some cases.

#### Why can’t I upload common documents such as doc, excel, and ppt?

Currently, the two models `Gemini 1.5 Pro` and `Gemini 1.5 Flash` support most images, audios, videos and some text files. For details. For other document types, we will try to use [LangChain.js](https://js.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/introduction/) later.
